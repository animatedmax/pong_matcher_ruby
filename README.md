# CF example app: ping-pong matching server

This is an app to match ping-pong players with each other. It's currently an
API only, so you have to use `curl` to interact with it.

It has an [acceptance test suite][acceptance-test] you might like to look at.

## Running on [Pivotal Web Services][pws]

Log in.

```bash
cf login -a https://api.run.pivotal.io
```

Target your org / space.

```bash
cf target -o myorg -s myspace
```

Sign up for a rediscloud instance.

```bash
cf create-service rediscloud 25mb baby-redis
```

Push this app. Its manifest assumes you called your Redis instance 'baby-redis'.

```bash
cf push -n mysubdomain
```

Export the test host

```bash
HOST=http://mysubdomain.cfapps.io
```

Now follow the [interaction instructions][#interaction_instructions].

## Running locally

The following assumes you have a working, recent version of Ruby, with bundler installed.

Install and start redis:

```bash
brew install redis
redis-server
```

In another terminal, start the application server:

```bash
bundle
PORT=3000 ruby server.rb
```

Export the test host

```bash
export HOST=http://localhost:3000
```

Now follow the [interaction instructions][#interaction_instructions].

## Interaction instructions

Start by clearing the database from any previous tests.
You should get a 200.

```bash
curl -v -X DELETE $HOST/all
```

Then request a match, providing both a request ID and player ID. Again, you
should get a 200.

```bash
curl -v -X PUT $HOST/match_requests/firstrequest -d '{"player": "andrew"}'
```

Now pretend to be someone else requesting a match:

```bash
curl -v -X PUT $HOST/match_requests/secondrequest -d '{"player": "navratilova"}'
```

Let's check on the status of our first match request:

```bash
curl -v -X GET $HOST/match_requests/firstrequest
```

The bottom of the output should show you the match_id. You'll need this in the
next step.

Now pretend that you've got back to your desk and need to enter the result:

```bash
curl -v -X POST $HOST/results -d '
{
    "match_id":"thematchidyoureceived",
    "winner":"andrew",
    "loser":"navratilova"
}'
```

You should get a 201 Created response.

Future requests with different player IDs should not cause a match with someone
who has already played. The program is not yet useful enough to
allow pairs who've already played to play again.
